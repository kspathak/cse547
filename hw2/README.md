# Homework 2

The full assignment can be found in [hw2.pdf](hw2.pdf). Solutions to all the
problems are described in detail in the [writeup.pdf](writeup.pdf).

## Problem 4

The multi-label classification models can be trained with the [run.py](run.py)
script. The instructions and script are very similar to the [Homework 1 Problem
6](/hw1/README.md#problem-6). This script requires the `features2` datasets. See
[/data/README.md](/data/README.md) for details.

The easiest way to run the script is with a Docker container: `./docker_run.sh
/hw2/run.py`. Here are some examples of configurations that you might want to
run.

TODO(pmp10): Add examples.
