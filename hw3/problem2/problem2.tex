\section*{Problem 2: Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for Angle Similarity}

Suppose our set of $n$ points $D = \left\{p_1,\ldots,p_n\right\}$ are vectors in
$d$ dimensions. Our problem is: given a query point $q$ find a point $p \in D$,
which has a small angle with $q$. Recall that the angle between two vectors $a$
and $b$ is
$\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{a \cdot b}{\lVert a \rVert \lVert b \rVert} \right).$

As doing this exactly may be computationally expensive, let us try to do this
approximately with a fast algorithm. The approximate objective is as follows:
suppose there exists a point $p \in D$ which has cosine similarity larger than
$\theta$, then our goal is return a point with cosine similarity greater than
$c\theta$.As doing this exactly may be computationally expensive, let us try to

Let us try to do this with LSH. Let us consider the a family of hash functions,
where $h(p) = \operatorname{sign}\left(u \cdot p\right)$ where we will sample
$u$ uniformly at random from a Gaussian (or from a unit sphere).

\begin{enumerate}
\item Provide an exact expression for
  $\mathbb{P}\left(h\left(p\right) = h\left(p^\prime\right)\right)$ based on
  some geometric relation between $p$ and $p^\prime$.

  \subsection*{Solution}

  Define
  \begin{equation}
    \operatorname{angle}\left(u, v\right) =
    \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{u \cdot v}{\lVert u \rVert \lVert v \rVert} \right),
  \end{equation}
  which is the angle between two vectors.

  Then,
  \begin{equation}
    \boxed{\mathbb{P}\left(h\left(p\right) = h\left(p^\prime\right)\right)
      = 1 - \frac{\operatorname{angle}\left(p,p^\prime\right)}{\pi}.}
  \end{equation}
\item Provide an expression for $P_1$ and $P_2$ in terms of $\theta$ and
  $c\theta$. Note that since we want a large angle
\item
